This is an innovative cloud-based entrance detection & control system using machine learning and computer vision at SR. 

It integrates functions of SID, temperature, and mask wearing detection with complete automation. The data collected will be transmitted to and analyzed in the cloud, and further visualized before posting to a website. Any abnormal situation will be notified. 

The project frees the labor of the securities, lowers the risk of infection through physical contact and upgrades the efficiency of the detecting & recording process to a great extent.

In addition to monitoring the SR, our project could potentially be applied to much wider scenarios such as miscellaneous entrance systems and be enhanced by integrating physical access control modules, for instance, automated gates, buzzers etc..
